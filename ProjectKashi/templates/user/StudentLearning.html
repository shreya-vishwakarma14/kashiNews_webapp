                The period of 1st generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of 1st generation used vacuum tubes
                because the basic parts for memory and electronic equipment for computer hardware (Central process
                Unit). These tubes, like electrical bulbs, created heaps of warmth and also the installations accustomed
                fuse ofttimes. Therefore, they were terribly expensive and solely giant organizations were able to
                afford it. In this generation, chiefly execution package was used. Punch cards, paper tape, and storage
                device was used as input and output devices. The computers during this generation used machine language
                because the programing language. The foremost vital computers were ENIAC and UNIVAC-1. UNIVAC was the
                world’s 1st commercially electronic computer.

                The world would see transistors replace vacuum tubes within the second generation of computers. The
                electronic transistor was fabricated at Bell Labs in 1947 however failed to see widespread use in
                computers till the late Fifties. Period of this computer is 1956-1963.
                The electronic transistor was so much superior to the thermionic vacuum tube, permitting computers to
                become smaller, faster, cheaper, a lot of energy-efficient, and a lot of reliable than their
                first-generation predecessors. Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to
                symbolic, or assembly, languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words. High-level
                programming languages were also being developed at this time, such as early versions of COBOL and
                FORTRAN.

                The time period of this computer is (1964-1971). The development of the microcircuit was the hallmark of
                the third generation of computers. Transistors were miniaturized and placed on atomic number 14 chips,
                referred to as semiconductors, that drastically multiplied the speed and potency of computers.
                Instead of punched cards and printouts, users interacted with third generation computers through
                keyboards ANd monitors and interfaced with an OS, that allowed the device to run many various
                applications at just one occasion with a central program that monitored the memory. Computers for the
                primary time became accessible to a mass audience as a result of they were smaller and cheaper than
                their predecessors.

                The time period of this computer is (1971-present). The silicon chip ushered within the fourth
                generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were engineered onto one micro chip. What
                within the initial generation stuffed a complete area might currently slot in the palm of the hand. The
                Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, set all the parts of the pc from the central process unit and memory
                to input/output controls on one chip.
                In 1981, IBM introduced its initial laptop for the house user, Fourth generation computers also saw the
                development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld
                devices.As these small computers became more powerful, they could be linked together to form networks,
                which eventually led to the development of the Internet.

                ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (PRESENT AND BEYOND), The period of fifth generation is 1980-till date. In the
                fifth generation, VLSI technology became
                ULSI (Ultra Large Scale Integration) technology, resulting in the production of microprocessor
                chips having ten million electronic
                components. This generation is based on parallel processing hardware and AI (Artificial
                Intelligence) software. AI is an emerging branch in computer science, which interprets the means and
                method
                of making computers think like human beings. All the high-level languages like C and C++, Java, .Net
                etc., are used
                in this generation. Some computer types of this generation are : Notebook, Chromebook, Robotic, Super
                Computer,

            <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light">
                Bitcoin is the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency. It enables peer-to-peer exchange of
                value in the digital realm through the use of a decentralized protocol, cryptography, and a mechanism to
                achieve global consensus on the state of a periodically updated public transaction ledger called a
                'blockchain.'<br>
                Bitcoin is a form of digital money that (1) exists independently of any government, state, or financial
                institution, (2) can be transferred globally without the need for a centralized intermediary, and (3)
                has a known monetary policy that arguably cannot be altered.<br>
                Bitcoin is known as a type of cryptocurrency because it uses cryptography to keep it secure. There are
                no physical bitcoins, only balances kept on a public ledger that everyone has transparent access to
                (although each record is encrypted). All Bitcoin transactions are verified by a massive amount of
                computing power via a process known as "mining."Bitcoin is not issued or backed by any banks or
                governments, nor is an individual bitcoin valuable as a commodity.

            <h3 style="color:#f6ed9b;">What is Bitcoin used for?</h3>
            <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light">
                In the early years, when network adoption was sparse, Bitcoin could be used to settle even small-value
                transactions, and do so competitively with payment networks like Visa and Mastercard (which, in fact,
                settle transactions long after point of sale).<br>
                as Bitcoin became more widely used, scaling issues made it less competitive as a medium of exchange for
                small-value items. In short, it became prohibitively expensive to settle small-value transactions due to
                limited throughput on the ledger and the lack of availability of second-layer solutions.<br>
                This supported the narrative that Bitcoin's primary value is less as a payment network and more as an
                alternative to gold, or 'digital gold.' Here, the argument is that Bitcoin derives value from a
                combination of the technological breakthroughs it integrates, its capped supply with
                'built-into-the-code' monetary policy, and its powerful network effects. In this regard, the investment
                thesis is that Bitcoin could replace gold and potentially become a form of 'pristine collateral' for the
                global economy.

        <h1 style="color:#f6ed9b;" class="text-center">How To Store Bitcoin?</h1>
        <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light mt-2">
            After reaching a peak in price late 2017 and subsequently fading from popularity, cryptocurrencies like
            Bitcoin have experienced a more another significant surge through 2019 and 2020, surpassing their previous
            all-time highs. As this has taken place, so too have the number of publicized hacking events increased as
            well. Given that many investors are new to the system and may not know how to keep their investments secure,
            hackers are coming up with ingenious ways of stealing funds. Some of the most prominent thefts have been
            those that have taken place in plain sight: some hacks even blatantly reroute tokens bound for one wallet
            for another.<br><br> The victims watch as their tokens are stolen away from them, with nothing they can do
            about
            it.
            Just the way we keep cash or cards in a physical wallet, bitcoins are also stored in a wallet—a digital
            wallet. The digital wallet can be hardware-based or web-based.
            Just like with your bank account or physical wallet, you need a place to store your bitcoin after purchasing
            it.

            Bitcoin is stored in digital wallets – a type of computer software that connects to the Bitcoin network.
            Just like bank cards have account numbers, digital wallets feature a unique address that can be shared with
            others when you make transactions.

            This unique address is a shorter, more usable version of your public key. It consists of between 26 and 35
            random alphanumeric characters and typically appears in this form:
            1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.<br><br>

            It is worth stating that every letter and number in this address is important. Always double-check a Bitcoin
            address before sending or receiving funds.
            Bitcoins are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain network. A special program – a “wallet” – is needed to
            access and use one’s coins. The wallet safeguards the secret code you need to use your bitcoins and
            helps manage transactions.
            If you want to know how to store bitcoin, here is the main thing you need to know - bitcoins are stored on
            the Bitcoin blockchain network. A special program – so-called “wallet” – is required in order to access and
            use one’s coins.

        <h2 style="color:#f6ed9b;" class="text-center">Keep your bitcoin private keys private</h2>
        <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light mt-2">
            A private key is used to verify that you own the public key. It allows you to access your wallet and to sign
            off on transactions. Some wallets automatically generate a secure seed phrase; a set of words that allow you
            to unlock your wallet if you lose your keys. Print out this phrase or write it on a piece of paper and keep
            it in a safe place. Never take a photo of or take a screenshot of your seed words.
            Anyone with access to your private key can easily access your wallet and steal your funds. Similarly, if you
            fail to securely store your private key and you lose it, chances are that you may never be able to recover
            your bitcoin.Your private key is like the key to your front door. It is something that only you want to be
            in possession of, and it is what keeps other people from being able to access the contents of your digital
            wallet.

        <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light mt-2">
            As with bank accounts, there are different types of wallets for storing your bitcoin, each offering its own
            set of pros and cons. In a broad sense, there are two main categories of bitcoin wallets:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light mt-2">
            <li>Hot wallets: These types of bitcoin wallets are connected to the internet and are typically available
                online
                or on your smartphone.
            </li>
            <li>Cold wallets: These types of bitcoin wallets cannot be accessed through the internet. They often involve
                physical devices (like a USB stick), where bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be stored securely
                offline.

                    <p style="text-align:justify; font-family:comic sans; font-size:18px;" class="text-light">
                        A study presents a broad survey of monogenetic volcanoes younger than 2.58 million years in the
                        U.S. Southwest.

                        They’re born. They live once, erupting for a period that might last for days, years or decades.
                        Then, they go dark and die.

                        This narrative describes the life of a monogenetic volcano, a type of volcanic hazard that can
                        pose important dangers despite an ephemeral existence.

                        The landscape of the southwestern U.S. is heavily scarred by past eruptions of such volcanoes,
                        and a new study marks a step toward understanding future risks for the region.

                        The research, which will be published on November 2, 2021, in the journal Geosphere, provides a
                        broad overview of what we know — and don’t know — about this type of volcanism in the U.S.
                        Southwest over the past 2.58 million years, a geologic period known as the Quaternary.
                        Monogenetic means ‘one life,’” says lead author Greg Valentine, a University at Buffalo
                        volcanologist. “So a monogenetic volcano will erupt once, and that eruption may last for several
                        days to several decades, but after that, the volcano is basically dead.

                                Oregon State University research has uncovered the first fossil evidence of a rare
                                botanical
                                condition known as precocious germination in which seeds sprout before leaving the
                                fruit.

                                In a paper published in Historical Biology, George Poinar Jr. of the Oregon State
                                College of
                                Science describes a pine cone, approximately 40 million years old, encased in Baltic
                                amber
                                from which several embryonic stems are emerging.

                                “Crucial to the development of all plants, seed germination typically occurs in the
                                ground
                                after a seed has fallen,” said Poinar, an international expert in using plant and animal
                                life forms preserved in amber to learn about the biology and ecology of the distant
                                past.
                                “We tend to associate viviparity – embryonic development while still inside the parent –
                                with animals and forget that it does sometimes occur in plants.”
                                Most typically, by far, those occurrences involve angiosperms, Poinar said. Angiosperms,
                                which directly or indirectly provide most of the food people eat, have flowers and
                                produce
                                seeds enclosed in fruit.

                                Researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory designed a novel
                                polymer to bind and strengthen silica sand for binder jet additive manufacturing, a
                                3D-printing method used by industries for prototyping and part production.
                                The printable polymer enables sand structures with intricate geometries and exceptional
                                strength – and is also water soluble.

                                The study, published in Nature Communications, demonstrates a 3D-printed sand bridge
                                that at
                                6.5 centimeters can hold 300 times its own weight, a feat analogous to 12 Empire State
                                Buildings sitting on the Brooklyn Bridge.
                                The binder jet printing process is cheaper and faster than other 3D-printing methods
                                used by
                                industry and makes it possible to create 3D structures from a variety of powdered
                                materials,
                                offering advantages in cost and scalability. The concept stems from inkjet printing, but
                                instead of using ink, the printer head jets out a liquid polymer to bind a powdered
                                material, such as sand, building up a 3D design layer by layer. The binding polymer is
                                what
                                gives the printed sand its strength.

                                The team used polymer expertise to tailor a polyethyleneimine, or PEI, binder that
                                doubled
                                the strength of sand parts compared with conventional binders.

                                degrees Celsius.
                                Over decades, centuries and millennia, the steady skyward climb of redwoods, the tangled
                                march of mangroves along tropical coasts and the slow submersion of carbon-rich soil in
                                peatlands has locked away billions of tons of carbon.<br>

                                If these natural vaults get busted open, through deforestation or dredging of
                                swamplands, it would take centuries before those redwoods or mangroves could grow back
                                to their former fullness and reclaim all that carbon. Such carbon is “irrecoverable” on
                                the timescale — decades, not centuries — needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate
                                change, and keeping it locked away is crucial.<br><br>
                                The new estimate puts the total amount of irrecoverable carbon at 139 gigatons,
                                researchers report November 18 in Nature Sustainability. That’s equivalent to about 15
                                years of human carbon dioxide emissions at current levels. And if all that carbon were
                                released, it’s almost certainly enough to push the planet past 1.5 degrees Celsius of
                                warming above preindustrial levels.
                                Researchers mapped the location and density of Earth’s irrecoverable carbon — carbon
                                locked in ecosystems that is potentially vulnerable to release from human development
                                and, if lost, could not be restored to those ecosystems by 2050. Areas of exceptionally
                                high density of irrecoverable carbon (purple) include the Pacific Northwest, the Amazon,
                                the Congo Basin and Borneo.

                    The World's First Microprocessor was designed and developed from 1968-1970. This site describes the
                    design work for a MOS-LSI, highly integrated, microprocessor chip set designed starting June 1968
                    and completed by June 1970. This highly integrated computer chip set was designed for the US Navy
                    F14A “TomCat” fighter jet by Mr. Steve Geller and Mr. Ray Holt as part of a design team while
                    working for Garrett AiResearch Corp under contract from Grumman Aircraft, the prime contractor for
                    the US Navy. The MOS-LSI chips, called the MP944, were manufactured by American Microsystems, Inc of
                    Santa Clara, California.<br>
                    The MOS-LSI chip set was part of the Central Air Data Computer (CADC) which had the function of
                    controlling the moving surfaces of the aircraft and the displaying of pilot information. The CADC
                    received input from five sources, 1) static pressure sensor, dynamic pressure sensor, analog pilot
                    information, temperature probe, and digital switch pilot input. The output of the CADC controlled
                    the moving surfaces of the aircraft.

                                generates better operating speeds. Intel released the Pentium processor on March 22,
                                1993. The processor become a 60 MHz processor, includes 3.1 million transistors and
                                sells for $878.00. Intel launched the second generation of Intel Pentium processors on
                                March 7, 1994. Cyrix released the Cx5x86 processor in 1995, in an attempt to compete
                                with the Intel Pentium processors. Cyrix launched their MediaGX processor in 1996. It
                                blended a processor with sound and video processing on one chip. Intel announced the
                                provision of the Pentium a hundred and fifty MHz with 60 MHz bus and 166 MHz with sixty

                    The Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) was developed by IBM in the early 1980s. It is a standard video
                    display card and computer display standard used to display text characters in monochrome text mode.
                    It has no real graphics mode of any kind. It displayed 80 columes X 25 lines of text characters on a
                    monitor, driven by its 4KB of video memory. It was meant to facilitate business and word processing
                    use, and actually originally features a parallel printer port on the card.<br>
                    Text characters were rendered in a box 9x14 (7x11 fpr the text character itself with the rest used
                    for spacing) pixels in size. Theoretically, the maximum resolution of MDA was 720 x 350 pixels. The
                    MDA supported text formatting that is commonplace in any text editor today, including underline,
                    bold, blinking text etc. but the only way to even simulate a feeling of graphics, or anything beyond
                    plain text, was with ANSI art. Unlike its successors, MDA could not address individual pixels, only
                    working in text mode with a limit of 256 characters stored in ROM on the card and unalterable by
                    software.
